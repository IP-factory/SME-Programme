/**
 * Single source of truth for programme and organisation identity.
 *
 * Every participant-facing name, sender identity and facilitator reference in the
 * client, server and email templates reads from here, so a rebrand is a change to
 * this file (plus matching test expectations) rather than a codebase-wide edit.
 *
 * The organisation identity and palette are IP Factory's. Programme names, facilitator and
 * mailbox values still describe JUMP 2026 until the product name and desk mailbox are set
 * (see docs/ipf-factory/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md, decisions D1–D4).
 *
 * Not covered here, by design:
 * - Stored identifiers (database enum values, cookie names, storage keys), which
 *   need a data migration to change.
 * - Payment beneficiary details, which belong to the payments workstream.
 * - Deployment origins and the Super Admin identity, which are environment configuration.
