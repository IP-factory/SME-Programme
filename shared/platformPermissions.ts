/**
 * Platform authority: what a person may do INSIDE IPF. It answers "what responsibility does this person have?" and
 * is separate from business membership ("which business may they act inside?"). One source of truth, code-defined:
 * roles are assigned in the database (`user_platform_roles`); what each role grants is decided here.
 *
 * Resolution rule (the only one; there is no "deny"): a permission is granted if ANY source grants it. Sources are
 *   1. the Super Admin bridge   - the recognised owner email, or a stored `super_admin` role: everything
 *   2. platform roles           - the matrix below (the legacy `users.role = 'admin'` counts as the `admin` role)
 *   3. the legacy admin profile - `admin_permission_profiles`, mapped to platform permissions below
 * so the legacy and the new systems can never contradict each other: adding a source can only add authority.
